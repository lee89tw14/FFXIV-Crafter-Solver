# FFXIV Crafting Optimizer Website

This project contains the source for the [FFXIV Crafting Optimizer Website](https://notranged.github.io/). It uses [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), [AngularUI Bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/), and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

# Updating item and food databases

For the notranged.github.io version of this tool, I have written a new Python scraper that pulls recipe, food, medicine data from xivapi.com. Whenever FFXIV gets updated with new crafting recipes, food, or medicine, run xivapi_calls.py found in the scripts directory. It will create new .json files for each job, food, and medicine in the /app/data or /data directory.

An alternative script can be found below;
At some point I made an [updated version of that script](https://github.com/NotRanged/ranged-lodestone-recipe-db-scraper) but idk what i changed about it anymore i forgor ðŸ’€

# Development (old readme)

### Running the app during development

You can pick one of these options:

* serve the `app` subdirectory in this repository with your webserver
* install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and run:
  * `npm install`
  * `npm start`
* install [browser-sync](https://www.browsersync.io/) and run:
  * `browser-sync start --port 8001 --server app --files app`
* install Docker and run:
  * `docker build --tag ffxiv-craft-opt-web-dev .`
  * `docker run -d --rm -it -p 8001:8001 ffxiv-craft-opt-web-dev`

The node.js, browser-sync and Docker methods options will serve the website on port 8001. Browser-sync should automatically launch your default browser and load the app.

Note that if you're using Docker on Windows or OS X via VirtualBox, you'll have to use the IP address of the Linux VM (usually 192.168.99.100) that is hosting Docker, instead of `localhost`. The Dockerfile.dev method will mount the app source as a volume so changes will be reflected when the browser is refreshed.

### Translations

Localization files can be found in `app/locale`. The `app/locale/en.json` file is purposefully missing because the English strings are used as the translation keys. Strings which require interpolation are defined in app.js so that they can be displayed immediately as a fallback until the actual locale json file finishes loading.
