  "ABOUT_TITLE": "What is this?",
  "ABOUT_INTRO": "This website is a crafting tool that tries to find a solution for your synthesis, using your own given crafting attributes and stats. It does this by means of a Genetic Algorithm. It makes thousands of semi-random guesses per second, and evaluates their results. The best guess is kept, and forms the base for the next round of guesses. In essence, it is using the brute force of your computer's CPU to find a better solution again and again. Sometimes it gets lucky and find an amazing, short and elegant solution in mere seconds- other times, it will do the weirdest most illogical things and can take a minute or more to solve your given synthesis. However, many improvements to this 'guessing' algorithm have been made since the original version hosted on Lokyst, and you will find that this version of the tool can come up with fairly good solutions in a greatly improved time!",
